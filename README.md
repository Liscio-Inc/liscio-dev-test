# Liscio Developer Test

## Introduction
Goal of test isn't to "gotcha" you and your rails knowledge.

It's to give a microcosm of our general app and an idea of the space we work in, while also providing you and us an opportunity to see what it's like to work together. Technical screens are hard to get right. There is a great deal of bias in them that generally hedges on the wrong things. We'd rather provide the candidate an opportunity to see if they like us and vice versa.

Bare with us, this will always be an evolving process! Long term goal is one test, but we're in the middle of the transition:)

## Problem Statement
The test is two parts. Let's add a controller action, test it, and then discuss what it would take to extend the functionality.

And also give space to ask questions around the culture and identity of Liscio
